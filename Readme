The problem statement is to identify contacts of coivd patients using cctv footage with face recognition.
Face recognition would not be straightforward to use because of the masks people wear.
So we performed transfer learning on VGGFace model to fien tune it to suit for masked face recognition.
The system identifies the person from the footage and tracks his movements in the video tracking people whom with he came in clsoe contacts.
Facial recognition is again used to identify those close contacts.
